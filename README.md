eCommerceAppExample

This application is an example of an eCommerce app that we developed alongside our trainers at the Software Development Academy.
This projects includes some Angular(TypeScript), CSS and HTML basics that our trainer showed us. 
We also deployed this mini-app on Heroku.


You can clone this app then use the 'npm install' then 'ng serve' commands to run it.
